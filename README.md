# Puppy Bowl react project

focus is on more execution on fetching APIs in a framework. 
https://fsa-puppy-bowl.herokuapp.com/api/

Using the similar format to render data from the API already created. 

Understanding how to navigate the API to create my application is going to be key in creating whatever projects I want with the correct data out there...

Get creative, focus on what information from these databases can I use to help accomplish a big problem for the average small to middle man business. 

# Tasks needed to be met:

See a list of each player competing in the bowl.

Click a "See Details" button or something similar on each player that will lead you to another page view with specific details on that player, such as owner and team name.

Have a form to CREATE a new player.

Search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list with only puppies with names that match the text in the search bar.

Create a button to DELETE a player (ONLY DELETE PLAYERS YOU YOURSELF CREATE, PLEASE!)
